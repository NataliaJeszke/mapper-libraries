# Mapping System for Libraries Schemas


## Description

Mapping System for Libraries Schemas is an application built on Next.js 13, utilizing the React DnD library and Tailwind CSS for styling. The primary purpose of this application is to facilitate the mapping of digital library schemas. It consists of three main windows: a left-side window for users to upload digital library schema files, a right-side window with a selection of default schemas to be mapped, and a middle window for dragging and associating tags from the left and right windows for mapping. After the tags are dragged into the mapping area, the resulting schema can be saved as a JSON file and downloaded to the user's local disk.

The JSON file format is widely used for client-server communication due to its versatility, making it suitable for integration with backend systems of digitized cultural and scientific object search engines or sharing with other digital libraries.

The application currently accepts two types of files: XML and XLSX (Excel files). XML files are a common format for digital library schemas and must include an attribute "ref" associated with the tag name, e.g., ref="Title". The application also reads nested "ref" attributes. Excel files should contain tags only in column A, listed one below the other, for example:
```
1:A Title
2:A Author
...
```

The application is designed to be easily extendable, with plans to support mapping of more file types (e.g., text, CSV) and additional default data schemas (e.g., MARC21).
